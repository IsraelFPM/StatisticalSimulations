# RandomWalk
A Random Walk is a random process that describes a path that consist of a sucession of random steps on some mathematical space. This project is to compare differents Probability Functions ( or Probability Density Function) and the path generated.

The path is created using comulative sums of random numbers generated by a Probability Functions for each dimension in each step of the path.

The Binary Walk is the path generated by choosing between -1 or +1 with equal chances. It is a discrete path.

The Normal Walk is the path generated by a Normal Distribuition with Mean equals to 0 and Standard Deviation equals to 0.33. It is a continuos path.

The Uniform Walk is the path generated by a Uniform Distribuition with limits between -1 and 1. It is a continuos path

# Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on the American television game show 'Let's Make a Deal' and named after the host Monty Hall. The problem became famous mostly because of a question from a reader to the Parade magazine in the 'Ask Marilyn' column.
The curiosity of the problem rely on how our intuition lead us to a false presumption and the surprise of how simple the reality presents.
